# Python Discord Bot

This simple code allows you to speak to a Discord Bot and receive answers from the GPT-3 wealth of knowledge.

See the Discord Developer instructions for how to configure a bot and get a token.

Similarly, see the OpenAI documentation to get an API Key.

Create a .env file to store your TOKEN and OPENAI_KEY for import at run time. Please keep in mind that these will be pushed to GitHub.
